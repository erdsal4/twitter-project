# twitter-project
This project is aimed to calculate the total engagement value of the tweets of a twitter account. The total engagement value is calculated by
finding out how many people "engaged" with a tweet indirectly by liking, commenting to, retweeting or quoting to a quote tweet of the original
tweet. This data is used to understand what kind of tweets engage a wider "network" of people, which might be a more insightful criteria than how many retweets or 
favourites a tweet has for people who want to understand which of their tweets are reacted to by people in an indirect way, not reflected in
their tweet's like or retweet numbers
